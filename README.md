# Yara-GODMODE
Based on the Yara Rules God mode from Florian Roth [repo](https://github.com/Neo23x0/god-mode-rules)

# Testing and Refinement:

Remember that these rules should be tested in a safe environment to ensure their effectiveness and to adjust for false positives.
Keep the rules up-to-date to adapt to new and evolving threats.
The 3 of them condition is set to trigger a match if at least three of the defined strings are found, balancing the detection scope with the minimization of false positives.
